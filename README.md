# Planner-Java

## Objective
This is a learning repository, currently I am participating in a coding event at the Rocket Seat platform.

The goal is to learn and understand how to create a REST API using Java, SpringBoot and Maven. The API itself will be consumed on the Front End of the project, which is a trip planner, where the user can create, update and delete trips, invite other people to trips and some other functionalities.
